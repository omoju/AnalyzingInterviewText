# Analyzing Interview Text

### An autonomous system for key phrase extraction from interview corpus.


This analysis was done to determine the effectiveness of UC Berkeley's [BJC](http://bjc.berkeley.edu/) curriculum in attracting historically underrepresented students into computer science. 
- This works owes thanks to [Alex Bowe](http://alexbowe.com/au-naturale/).
- The work was done as part of a doctoral study in Computer Science education.
