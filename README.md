# Analyzing Interview Text

### An autonomous system for key phrase extraction from interview corpus.


This analysis was done to determine the effectiveness of UC Berkeley's [BJC](http://bjc.berkeley.edu/) curriculum in attracting historically underrepresented students into computer science. 
- This works owes thanks to [Alex Bowe](http://alexbowe.com/au-naturale/).
- The work was done as part of a doctoral study in Computer Science education.

This project requires Python 2.7 and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)

In addition, you will need to be able to run an jupyter Notebook to do something similar with your data.


## Run

In a terminal/command window, go to the top-level project directory `AnalyzingInterviewText/` (that contains this README). Then run:

```jupyter notebook appropriateNotebookName.ipynb```


## Publication
- [Its Deeper than Rap: Toward Culturally Responsive CS](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2604994)
- [Gaining insights into the effects of culturally responsive curriculum on historically underrepresented students’ desire for computer science](Miller_ASEE_2016_DRAFT.pdf) To be presented at in ASEE 2016

## Data

The dataset that is used in this project is unfortunately not available for mass consumption, as it contains sensitive, *personally identifiable* student data.

- A corpus of transcribed, 30-45 minute, semi-structured qualitative interviews with participants.
